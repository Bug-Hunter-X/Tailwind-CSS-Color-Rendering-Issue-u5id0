# Tailwind CSS Color Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with Tailwind CSS where the expected color is not being rendered correctly. The issue arises when applying specific Tailwind CSS classes to an element.

## Problem

The code within `bug.js` shows an example where text within a div should be gray based on the assigned class (`text-gray-500` for example). However, the rendered color is different from the expected color. 

## Solution

The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the problem. This might include adjusting the class names, confirming proper configuration of Tailwind, inspecting conflicting CSS, ensuring proper file inclusion, or solving some other potential problem causing the conflict.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the code (implementation details depend on your project setup).
3. Observe that the text color does not match expectations. 
4. Examine `bugSolution.js` for a possible fix.
